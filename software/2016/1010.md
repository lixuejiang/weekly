**The State of JavaScript – Survey results**  
http://stateofjs.com/2016/introduction/  
Over nine thousand developers took part in the first edition of the State Of JavaScript survey. They answered questions on topics ranging from front-end frameworks and state management, to build tools and testing libraries. You'll find out which libraries developers most want to learn next, and which have the highest satisfaction ratings. And hopefully, this data will help you make sense of the ever-changing JavaScript ecosystem.

**Reflections of an "Old" Programmer**  
http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2016/reflections-of-an-old-programmer.php  
一位 40 岁的程序员的思考，这几个观点挺不错的：knowledge decay, Half of what a programmer knows will be useless in 10 years; knowledge accumulation rate, the pace at which we add new things to our knowledge corpus; take the long view, making less money in the short term (at a better employer) will yield more money (and stability) over the course of a long career; invest most in knowledge that is durable, spent accumulating knowledge that has a longer half-life - algorithms, application security, performance optimization, and architecture. 

**TypeScript - The Myth of the Superset**  
http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2016/10/myth-of-superset.html  
TypeScript claims to be a superset of JavaScript. Many TypeScript presentations start with a picture of concentrical circles illustrating that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This fact is a major value proposition of TypeScript over other “Compile-to-JavaScript” languages. It is the base for a gradual migration of a legacy project to TypeScript and it is the base for a frictionless integration with the JavaScript ecosystem.
