**Introducing FlyWeb**  
https://flyweb.github.io/posts/2016/11/01/introducing-flyweb.html  
For the past several months, a small team at Mozilla has been working on an experimental new Web API and an accompanying browser feature called FlyWeb. What does it do? In short, FlyWeb provides an API for web pages to host local web servers for exposing content and services to nearby browsers. It also adds the ability to discover and connect to nearby local web servers to the web browser itself. This feature allows users to find and connect to nearby devices with embedded web servers such as printers, thermostats and televisions as well as local web servers hosted in web pages via the FlyWeb API.

**Coding is not the new literacy**  
http://www.chris-granger.com/2015/01/26/coding-is-not-the-new-literacy/  
Despite the good intentions behind the movement to get people to code, both the basic premise and approach are flawed. The movement sits on the idea that "coding is the new literacy," but that takes a narrow view of what literacy really is.

**Stateful and stateless components, the missing manual**  
https://toddmotto.com/stateful-stateless-components  
The goals of this article are to define what stateful and stateless components are, otherwise known as smart and dumb - or container and presentational components. For the purposes of the article, we’ll be using Angular 2 Components to explain the stateful/stateless concepts. Bear in mind these concepts are not at all limited to Angular, and live in other libs/frameworks such as React.

**React.js Introduction For People Who Know Just Enough jQuery To Get By**  
http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/  
I also heard React.js was good and recently spent some time playing with it. Now that I’m pretty comfortable with React, I decided to write a tutorial on this subject.

**shadow DOM v1: self-contained web components**  
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/shadowdom/  
Shadow DOM fixes CSS and DOM. It introduces scoped styles to the web platform. Without tools or naming conventions, you can bundle CSS with markup, hide implementation details, and author self-contained components in vanilla JavaScript.

**The Standard Library of the Internet**  
https://stdlib.com/  
Our vision is simple — we believe every developer should be able to interface with the cloud as if it were an extension of their personal computer. Write backend code, push to stdlib as a microservice and have your logic available everywhere. No servers, no hassle. 

**Microsoft REST API Guidelines**
https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md
The Microsoft REST API Guidelines, as a design principle, encourages application developers to have resources accessible to them via a RESTful HTTP interface. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers on platforms following the Microsoft REST API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow consistent design guidelines to make using them easy and intuitive.

**Create Apps with No Configuration**  
https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html  
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app  
Create React App is a new officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration. 来自 React 官方的开发者配套开发工具，挺值得研究的。

**Monaco Editor**

**Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository**  
http://m.cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W71BTkUbdqE  
This article outlines the scale of that codebase and details Google's custom-built monolithic source repository and the reasons the model was chosen. Google uses a homegrown version-control system to host one large codebase visible to, and used by, most of the software developers in the company. This centralized system is the foundation of many of Google's developer workflows. Here, we provide background on the systems and workflows that make feasible managing and working productively with such a large repository. We explain Google's "trunk-based development" strategy and the support systems that structure workflow and keep Google's codebase healthy, including software for static analysis, code cleanup, and streamlined code review. 

**High Performance Browser Networking**  
https://hpbn.co/  
Performance is a feature. This book provides a hands-on overview of what every web developer needs to know about the various types of networks (WiFi, 3G/4G), transport protocols (UDP, TCP, and TLS), application protocols (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2), and APIs available in the browser (XHR, WebSocket, WebRTC, and more) to deliver the best—fast, reliable, and resilient—user experience.  

**写给想成为前端工程师的同学们 - by 月影**  
https://www.h5jun.com/post/to-be-a-good-frontend-engineer.html   如果我们不去了解技术的本质而止步于应用，那么我们就只是技术宗教的信徒。热爱前端，用心学习，别让自己成为“前端教”的教众。在选择前端作为职业之前，要明确判断自己对前端开发的确感兴趣，选择做前端，应该是确认自己喜欢和适合做前端，而不是为了一份看起来体面而且薪水不菲的工作。如果你对构建丰富多彩的界面、处理各种交互逻辑不感兴趣，甚至厌烦，那么最明智的选择是放弃成为前端工程师的想法 —— 因为选择一个自己不喜欢的职业，为之忍受数十年直到退休，实在是一件很悲催的事情。

**资深程序员都了解的代码复用法则**  
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMDU1MTE1OQ==&mid=2653547118&idx=1&sn=733737f71a751feea5c2d2ca5ea3adbe  
编写代码最重要一条，是怎样复用其他程序员的代码和思路来解决问题。通过修改他人的代码来解决复杂问题是种错误的做法，不仅成功的机率很低，就算成功也不会提供什么经验。按照这种方式进行编程，无法成长为一名真正的程序员，在软件开发领域，前景也是非常有限。

关系型数据库非常有趣，因为它们是基于实用而且可复用的概念。如果你对了解一个数据库感兴趣，但是从未有时间或意愿来刻苦钻研这个内容广泛的课题，你应该喜欢这篇文章。

**How to be a Programmer: Community Version**  
https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer/  
To be a good programmer is difficult and noble. The hardest part of making real a collective vision of a software project is dealing with one's coworkers and customers. Writing computer programs is important and takes great intelligence and skill. But it is really child's play compared to everything else that a good programmer must do to make a software system that succeeds for both the customer and myriad colleagues for whom she is partially responsible. In this essay I attempt to summarize as concisely as possible those things that I wish someone had explained to me when I was twenty-one.

**A Protocol for Dying**
http://hintjens.com/blog:115
ZeroMQ 社区创始人之一，分布式系统专家 Pieter Hintjens 一周前发现自己的胆管癌已经扩散到肺部，他意识到自己剩下的时间不多了。Pieter 写过三十多份通讯协议和规格书，这次他给自己写了一份“临终协议”。如何与临终者交谈，临终者有何责任，如何向孩子们解释，以及，如何面对死亡。

**为什么谷歌的服务从来不会崩溃？**
http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5ODIzNTc2MA==&mid=412331950&idx=1&sn=bab734f17b3baa97c66cb19a1f635baf
把开发和运维结合起来，乃至把运维融合到代码之中，谷歌以此来调和开发与运维之间的结构性冲突。Google 提出了一个概念：网站可靠性管理（Site Reliability Engineering，简称SRE）。期望：在未来的世界里，运维能够更进一步变成代码的一部分；我们期待着有朝一日，不需要人进行任何管理。这是对应的书籍： [Site Reliability Engineering](https://landing.google.com/sre/book.html) ，Notes on Google's Site Reliability Engineering Book

**Strategic Scala Style: Principle of Least Powe**  
http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStylePrincipleofLeastPower.html  
新加坡总理李显龙的孙子李浩毅现在是Dropbox的工程师，最近刚写了一份Effective Scala风格的文档“Strategic Scala Style: Principle of Least Power”

**Docker - libcontainer Principles**  
https://github.com/docker/libcontainer/blob/master/PRINCIPLES.md  
In the design and development of libcontainer we try to follow these principles:    
- Don't try to replace every tool. Instead, be an ingredient to improve them.
- Less code is better.
- Fewer components are better. Do you really need to add one more class?

**The Wetware Crisis: the Dead Sea effect**  
http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/  
【死海效应】公司发展到一定阶段，能力强的员工容易离职，因为他们对公司内愚蠢的行为的容忍度不高，他们也容易找到好工作；能力差的员工倾向于留着不走，他们也不太好找工作，年头久了，他们就变中高层了。文章把这种现象叫做死海效应：好员工像死海的水一样蒸发掉，然后死海盐度就变得很高，正常生物不容易存活：）

**The Definitive Guide to Linux System Calls**  
http://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2016/04/05/the-definitive-guide-to-linux-system-calls/  
This blog post explains how Linux programs call functions in the Linux kernel. It will outline several different methods of making systems calls, how to handcraft your own assembly to make system calls (examples included), kernel entry points into system calls, kernel exit points from system calls, glibc wrappers, bugs, and much, much more.

**编程的智慧**  
http://www.yinwang.org/blog-cn/2015/11/21/programming-philosophy  
编程是一种创造性的工作，是一门艺术。精通任何一门艺术，都需要很多的练习和领悟，所以这里提出的“智慧”，并不是号称一天瘦十斤的减肥药，它并不能代替你自己的勤奋。然而由于软件行业喜欢标新立异，喜欢把简单的事情搞复杂，我希望这些文字能给迷惑中的人们指出一些正确的方向，让他们少走一些弯路，基本做到一分耕耘一分收获。

**What if we had a great standard library in JavaScript?**  
https://medium.com/@thomasfuchs/what-if-we-had-a-great-standard-library-in-javascript-52692342ee3f  
Micro.js http://microjs.com/ 发起者对 JS 生态思考。A standard library would make it a lot easier to write JavaScript by eliminating the need to come up with similar or same solutions to small issues.

**The Deep Roots of Javascript Fatigue**  
https://segment.com/blog/the-deep-roots-of-js-fatigue/  
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11294218  
Like it or not, Javascript is evolving at a faster rate than any widespread language in the history of computing. Most of the tools we use today didn’t even really exist a year ago: React, JSX, Flux, Redux, ES6, Babel, etc. Even setting up a ‘modern’ project requires installing a swath of dependencies and build tools that are all new. No other language does anything remotely resembling that kind of thing. It’s enough to even warrant a “State of the Art” post so everyone knows what to use. So, why does Javascript change so much? 

**~2015 in review**  
https://medium.com/@sebmck/2015-in-review-51ac7035e272  
This started off as a generic year in review but as I was writing it became a lot more personal. This is my story of how I dealt with going from high school to moving to another country and working in big tech in a little over a year. 

**Why I No Longer Use MVC Frameworks**
http://www.infoq.com/articles/no-more-mvc-frameworks
The worst part of my job these days is designing APIs for front-end developers. The conversation goes inevitably as:Dev – So, this screen has data element x,y,z… could you please create an API with the response format {x: , y:, z: } Me – Ok. I don’t even argue anymore. Projects end up with a gazillion APIs tied to screens that change often, which, by “design” require changes in the API and before you know it, you end up with lots of APIs and for each API many form factors and platform variants. A couple of months ago, I started a journey to understand why we ended up here and what could be done about it, a journey that lead me to question the strongest dogma in application architecture, MVC, and where I touched the sheer power of reactive and functional programming, a journey focused on simplicity and scraping the bloat that our industry is so good at producing.
文章的信息量很大，索引了很多优质文章，对 React、Angular、MVC、GraphQL 等的分析还是挺不错的，对比了各种 Web应用 开发方式后，提出了一种叫 SAM 的模式，值得认真阅读。

**The Error Model**  
http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/  
The basic question an Error Model seeks to answer is: how do “errors” get communicated to programmers and users of the system? Pretty simple, no? So it seems. This journey was long and winding. To tell the tale, I’ve broken this post into six major areas:  
- Ambitions and Learnings  
- Bugs Aren’t Recoverable Errors!  
- Reliability, Fault-Tolerance, and Isolation  
- Bugs: Abandonment, Assertions, and Contracts  
- Recoverable Errors: Type-Directed Exceptions  
- Retrospective and Conclusions

讨论 JS 、Web 开发、前端生态，起因是第2篇文章，观点挺偏激的，引发了激烈的讨论，不过的确指出了 Web 生态圈面临的一些问题。第1篇文章比较中肯，指出了关键点在于：选择和集成成本太高，作者也在试图建立一个知识库来解决技术选型问题，这是他采集信息的一个调研： [Should I Use](https://alterx.typeform.com/to/ASrKf9)。这两个文章还引申出两个有意思的东西：[Magpie Developer](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-magpie-developer/)、[The programming language cycle](http://quoderat.megginson.com/2006/03/06/programming-languages-of-distinction/)。
相比之下，最近由 [真阿当-当我说前端基础时，我在说什么](http://weibo.com/p/1001603933000810243086) 引发的国内前端界大讨论就平和多了：
- [知乎-如何评价-当我说前端基础时...](https://www.zhihu.com/question/39659757)
- [Vue.js 作者-谈谈前端新技术](http://weibo.com/p/1001603934708609234550)
- [为这几天前端方向所撕的逼做个大总结](http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309403934449430569795)
- http://weibo.com/1693534972/DeAL1tRvy
前端是一个年轻的生态，我们的路还很长，怀着敬畏和谦逊之心、脚踏实地去解决路上的各种问题才是正道。

**How one developer just broke Node, Babel and thousands of projects in 11 lines of JavaScript**  
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/  
http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm  
一个函数引发的血案： A couple of hours ago, Azer Koçulu unpublished more than 250 of his modules from NPM, which is a popular package manager used by JavaScript projects to install dependencies.  Unfortunately, one of those dependencies was left-pad.  With left-pad removed from NPM, these applications and widely used bits of open-source infrastructure were unable to obtain the dependency, and thus fell over.
另外之前还有人讨论过，npm 是有安全隐患的，比如万一依赖最高的那个包 lodash 被盗号了，通过 npm 脚本就可以做任何事，所以希望能尽快改进，加上签名机制，不然迟早会出事。这个问题引发的讨论和思考还是挺值得关注的，相关阅读：

**JavaScript web apps considered valuable**
http://molily.de/javascript-web-apps/
Recalling best practices for web applications that make heavy use of client-side JavaScript. The solution for bad JavaScript web apps is not to abandon them altogether, but to make better ones. We need to stop excluding JavaScript apps from “the web as it was intended”. JavaScript apps are “on the web” just like other sites. The potential of the web is enormous and we have just started.

**Front-end Application Libraries and Component Architectures**  
http://developer.telerik.com/featured/front-end-application-frameworks-component-architectures/  
Component architectures are an important part of ever modern front-end framework. In this article, I’m going to dissect Polymer, React, Rio.js, Vue.js, Aurelia and Angular 2 components. The goal is to make the commonalities between each solution obvious. Hopefully, this will convince you that learning one or the other isn’t all that complex, given that everyone has somewhat settled on a component architecture.

**What can we learn from how jQuery symbiotically pushed the Web Platform forward?**  
https://medium.com/ben-and-dion/what-can-we-learn-from-how-jquery-symbiotically-pushed-the-web-platform-forward-ce6b20cd4e98  
One of the great things about jQuery was that it had a simple, powerful idea. It’s entire mindset was “find these items in the DOM, and attach these events to them”. The fluent style of API probably opened peoples minds up in a way that only helped us with promises and rethinking APIs such as XHR vs. fetch. 
All in all jQuery has evolved along with the Web platform, helping improve things beyond itself.

**JavaScript At Scale — Achieving High Velocity**  
https://labs.mlssoccer.com/javascript-at-scale-achieving-high-velocity-160c7d78af03  
Many companies choose JavaScript because it is touted as flexible and fast. While this may be true, that same flexibility and speed can get you in a few traps if you are not thoughtful in how you build your JavaScript ecosystem.

几个月之前，我承诺要针对之前的一篇针对我的 Roguelike 游戏的 blog：回合制的游戏主循环（turn-based game loops）。然后我就投入到我自己发行的新书：《游戏编程模式（Game Programming Patterns）》中去，并且把这件事情彻底忘掉了。我把大家扔在一边了～～好，今天我终于有时间再思考一下我的 Roguelike 了，那么，忘掉游戏主循环，让我们来研究一下 Roguelike 游戏最有趣也是最有挑战的部分：生成地牢！

**The Zen of Erlang**  
http://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html  
I assume most people here have never used Erlang, have possibly heard of it, maybe just the name. As such, this presentation will only cover the high level concepts of Erlang, in such a way that it may be useful to you in your work or side projects even if you never touch the language.

**Why do we work so hard?**  
https://www.1843magazine.com/features/why-do-we-work-so-hard  
Maybe it’s because work is satisfying. Maybe it’s because we’re trapped. Or maybe, as Ryan Avent suspects, it’s because of a troubling combination of the two
