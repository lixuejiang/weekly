**Parsing absolutely anything in JavaScript using Earley algorithm**  
https://medium.com/@gajus/parsing-absolutely-anything-in-javascript-using-earley-algorithm-886edcc31e5e#.cuq6xq1y8  
http://nearley.js.org/  
Let me start by saying — I was surprised how easy it was to write grammar for an Earley parser. I have been using regular expressions for over a decade. And I am used to parse things using regular expressions. Its fragile, its not always possible, etc. But it is fast and for the most part it serves the purpose. Familiarising with parsing algorithms changed this attitude forever. This is a long article. Therefore, I have used the He Man meme to keep you entertained throughout the journey. I promise you an all-powerful weapon at the end of the article. 

**Refactoring 30000 lines of JS with types**  
https://www.reaktor.com/blog/refactoring-30000-lines-js-types/  
30000 lines of client-side JavaScript. No tests. Two difficult TV deployment platforms with poor tooling. Strong dependencies on poorly documented external APIs. The task: add support for a third TV platform to the two supported platforms and switch to a new backend with a different API. How can we do this without breaking things? Some parts of the application could be tested and this was a part of how we made this change. But the more interesting idea we tried was to refactor with types.

**Using Immutable Caching To Speed Up The Web**  
https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/  
The benefits of immutable mean that when a page is refreshed, which is an extremely common social media scenario, elements that were previously marked immutable with an HTTP response header do not have to be revalidated with the server. Lacking this hint, the browser needs to guess which objects may or may not change on reload – wasting time on one hand or risking website incompatibility on the other.

**How I wrote the world's fastest JavaScript memoization library**  
https://community.risingstack.com/the-worlds-fastest-javascript-memoization-library/  
In this article, I’ll show you how I wrote the world’s fastest JavaScript memoization library called [fast-memoize.js](https://github.com/caiogondim/fast-memoize.js) - which is able to do 50 million operations / second.

**Optimizing the Performance of Your React Application**  
https://auth0.com/blog/optimizing-react/  
Profiling your React code is simple using the tools providing by the react-addons-perf package. Once you know where React is wasting time, you can improve the performance by using the correct keys, implementing shouldComponentUpdate in your components, and extending from PureComponent instead of regular Component.

**How to Make Uploading 10x Faster**  
https://blog.daftcode.pl/how-to-make-uploading-10x-faster-f5b3f9cfcd52#.te54hjhna  
When we’ve noticed that our app was responding slowly, we tried the usual optimisations. But the effect wasn’t really satisfying. As it turned out, the slowest part of our application was uploading files. But is it even possible to make uploading faster?

**The 21 Most Awesome Awesome Lists for Node.js Developers**  
https://nodesource.com/blog/the-21-most-awesome-awesome-lists-for-node-js-developers  
This is a collection of some of the best awesome lists that are part of or are highly relevant to Node.js itself. Each one of them is an absolute gold mine of resources to start using to grow as a Node.js developer.

**INDENTATION IS THE ENEMY: WRITING LESS COMPLEX JAVASCRIPT**  
http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2017/indentation-is-the-enemy-less-complex-javascript/  
I’ve been working a lot with a legacy code-base lately. And this one is particularly troublesome. It has all the hallmarks of a rush job. The code is brittle. There are no tests. Things often seem to break at random. And to my embarrassment, I wrote most of it. Part of the problem is that this is a complicated application. There are three different servers involved, and many different application features. But the trouble is not with the scope of the app. The trouble is with the code itself. Everything is intertwined, like spaghetti. And it’s this intertwining that makes it complicated.

**Immutability in JavaScript using Redux**  
https://www.toptal.com/javascript/immutability-in-javascript-using-redux  
Using immutable states allows us to write code that can quickly tell if the state has changed, without needing to do a recursive comparison on the data, which is usually much, much faster. This article will cover the practical applications of Redux when managing state through action creators, pure functions, composed reducers, impure actions with Redux-saga and Redux Thunk and, finally, use of Redux with React. That said, there are a lot of alternatives to Redux, such as MobX, Relay, and Flux based libraries.

**Event Sourcing with Examples - Node.js at Scale**  
https://blog.risingstack.com/event-sourcing-with-examples-node-js-at-scale/  
Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern to handle complex application states that may need to be rebuilt, re-played, audited or debugged. From this article you can learn what Event Sourcing is, and when should you use it. We’ll also take a look at some Event sourcing examples with code snippets.

**The JavaScript Standard**  
https://ponyfoo.com/articles/standard  
JavaScript has gone from being a 1995 marketing ploy to gain a tactical advantage, to becoming the core programming experience in the world’s most widely used application runtime platform in 2017. The language doesn’t merely run in browsers anymore, but is also used to create desktop and mobile applications, in hardware devices, and even in the vacuum of space. How did JavaScript get here, and where is it going next?

**ECMAScript regular expressions are getting better!**  
https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es-regexp-proposals  
This article highlights what’s happening in the world of JavaScript regular expressions right now. Spoiler: it’s quite a lot — there are more RegExp-related proposals currently advancing through the TC39 standardization process than there have been updates to RegExp in the history of ECMAScript!

**ES proposal: Shared memory and atomics**  
http://www.2ality.com/2017/01/shared-array-buffer.html  
The ECMAScript proposal [Shared memory and atomics](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem) by Lars T. Hansen has reached stage 4 this week and will be part of ECMAScript 2017. It introduces a new constructor SharedArrayBuffer and a namespace object Atomics with helper functions. This blog post explains the details.

**Align SVG Icons to Text and Say Goodbye to Font Icons**  
https://blog.prototypr.io/align-svg-icons-to-text-and-say-goodbye-to-font-icons-d44b3d7b26b4#.rutqvgald  
With an SVG icon system you can better meet accessibility standards, render higher quality visuals, and add/remove/modify icons in the library with ease. At Pivotal we’ve created an SVG icon system with React for use on our suite of products. This article is about my approach to styling the SVG icon system with CSS to make it easy and effective to use.

**Making Responsive HTML Email Coding Easy With MJML**  
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/making-responsive-html-email-coding-easy-with-mjml/  
https://mjml.io/documentation/#mjml-navbar  
Email is one of the best ways to engage with your users, especially during the holiday season. However, if you want to stand out, no matter how beautiful your emails are, you need to make sure they render correctly in your reader’s inbox, regardless of what email client they’re using. Creating responsive email is not an easy task, and there are various reasons for that.

**Things Every Hacker Once Knew - by Eric S. Raymond**  
http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/things-every-hacker-once-knew/  
This document is a collection of facts about ASCII and related technologies, notably hardware terminals and RS-232 and modems. This is lore that was at one time near-universal and is no longer. It’s not likely to be directly useful today - until you trip over some piece of still-functioning technology where it’s relevant (like a GPS puck), or it makes sense of some old-fart war story. Even so, it’s good to know anyway, for cultural-literacy reasons.

**Chrome 56 Will Aggressively Throttle Background Tabs**  
http://blog.strml.net/2017/01/chrome-56-now-aggressively-throttles.html  
Chrome 56 introduces a commendable optimization to throttle background tabs' timers. From the Intent to Implement, the gist is:  
- Each WebView has a budget (in seconds) for running timers in background.  
- A timer task is only allowed to run when the budget is non-negative.  
- After a timer has executed, its run time is subtracted from the budget.  
- The budget regenerates with time (at rate of 0.01 seconds per second).  

**Reload, reloaded: faster and leaner page reloads**  
https://blog.chromium.org/2017/01/reload-reloaded-faster-and-leaner-page_26.html  
Chrome now has a simplified reload behavior to only validate the main resource and continue with a regular page load. This new behavior maximizes the reuse of cached resources and results in lower latency, power consumption, and data usage.

焦虑本身其实是一种积极的状态，表明个体还有所追求，实际上它也是不能克服的，但需要被缓解，被引导升华。如何应对？以『问题』为中心；设立一个小目标，日拱一卒，不求速成；放弃 "All in" 心态，编程是一种生活，但不是全部，向斜杠青年学习。
